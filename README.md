# Convert json files to xlsx

This project converts files json to xlsx.

You have to create folders and replace it on the next variable call **_folder_** in each convert.

You can create as many as folders you need it, inside excel and json folders.

Some examples are:

- Excel
    - folder_name-01-31Dec
    - folder_name-01-31Jan
- Json
    - folder_name-01-31Dec
    - folder_name-01-31Jan

On those cases you have the same folder name in excel and json, this is because the json file inside folder one, should be save on xlsx in the same folder but in excel folder.
